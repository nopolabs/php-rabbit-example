Example code for testing and understanding interactions between PHP and RabbitMQ

Uses composer to load dependencies. See http://getcomposer.org

send.php
  usage: send.php [auto|basic] [count]
  e.g. php -f send.php auto 100

  auto and basic are used to selected a queue and a routingKey
  with either autoAck or basicAck behavior. Actually implementing
  those behaviors is the responsibility of the queue consumer,
  see recv.php

recv.php
  usage: recv.php [auto|basic]
  e.g. php -f recv.php auto
